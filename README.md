Grid Collision Demo
===================

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

This project demonstrates how to check for Segment vs. Grid and AABB vs. Grid collision.

Demo Usage
----------

TThis demo project is a sample Grid implementation and a Windows Forms window for interacting with it.

Click anywhere in the grid space to toggle whether that cell is filled, and click and drag on the start and destination points to move them around.

The solid green segment shows the travel of the segment, and the dashed red segment shows the part of the segment that was obscured by a hit.
