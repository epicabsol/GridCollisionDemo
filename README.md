Grid Collision Demo
===================

(TODO: Screenshot)

This project demonstrates how to check for AABB vs. Grid collision.

Demo Usage
----------

The demo is a sample Grid implementation and a Windows Form window for interacting with it.

Click anywhere in the grid space to toggle whether that cell is filled, and click and drag on the start and end points to move them around.
